#HackMe Challenge

This challenge offers you to work on moderate database to predict the output (Yes/No). The main characteristic of this challenge for you is to build such a model which has the ability to scale
on very huge datasets with thousands of instances and attributes.

The database also contains categorical variables. There are strings corresponding to category codes. This could be for instance a town name. Also, the actual names are replaced by strings
that are meaningless.You are expected to deal with noisy data and prepare/preprocess and do the data modeling in the terms of industrial real data. The detection of the attributes that are
most important to the output prediction can be a key factor in this challenge. It is an opportunity to showcase that you can deal with a database which has large number of features, including
heterogeneous noisy data (numerical and categorical variables), and unbalanced class distributions.

Also, there is no data dictionary available this time as you have to figure out on your own which variables makes sense to your model for prediction. Next week, you will be receiving similar
database but will thousands of new attributes to help your model in predicting the output. You should explore Distributed computing platform and try executing this challenge using something
like Pyspark, MLLib, and AWS etc. Although, it is not compulsory but advisable so that you get some exposure to machine learning using cluster computing.
